    One sadden moment I read your poetry,<br>
    Deep with significant messages, got pity with my vocabulary,<br>
    What a wonderful legendary poem story created beautifully.<br>
    Bravo, hooray! , , , it hooked my heart amazingly,<br>
    <br>
    A mail links popped-up on my search out of the blue,<br>
    Seeing with my two eyes rolling and open wide, no it can't be,<br>
    Copy paste poetry? ? ? Can't call it your own piece,<br>
    Not a genuine poet; with false charade and intelligence.<br>
    <br>
    Copy paste poetry lines from the internet search out,<br>
    Words are flowery so as lines are always with doubt,<br>
    Lies behind the copy paste poems, it gains distrust,<br>Craft your poem with honesty and integrity, please do my dear
poet.
